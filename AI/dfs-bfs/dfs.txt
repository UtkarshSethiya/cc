DFS algorithm in python or in general is used for searching and traversing data structure. DFS algorithm uses the idea of backtracking, in which one node is selected as the root node and it starts traversing them one by one. DFS algorithm is used to perform the searching and traversing for the data structure like tree and graph. while doing the DFS algorithm, it first chooses the left node before the right node and starts traversing them one by one. Once the particular node being travers or visited, it will not visit them again until the searching elements found out, DFS in general stands for depth-first search, it will always first visit the left node followed by the right node associating with them. In python, we can easily implement it by the use of sets and dictionaries, and make use of recursion also to make this work. In the coming section of the tutorial, we will see how to implement a depth-first search in Python, for a better understanding of the algorithm for beginners.
